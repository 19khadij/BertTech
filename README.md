Sentiment Analysis with BERT
This code performs sentiment analysis on text data using a BERT-based model. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and inference on new text data.

Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the following libraries and resources installed:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Transformers library (Hugging Face)
nltk (Natural Language Toolkit)
pandas
scikit-learn
tqdm (for progress bars)
You can install these dependencies using pip:


pip install tensorflow transformers nltk pandas scikit-learn tqdm
Getting Started
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-bert.git
cd sentiment-analysis-bert
Download the BERT model weights. You can use the 'bert-base-uncased' model for this code. Download it from the Hugging Face Model Hub.

Place the downloaded BERT model files in the project directory.

Prepare your dataset in a CSV file format with at least two columns: 'Clean_coment' and 'Output'. 'Clean_coment' contains the text data, and 'Output' contains the sentiment labels (e.g., 'positive', 'negative', 'neutral').

Data Preprocessing
The code includes data preprocessing steps, such as removing stopwords and lemmatization. It tokenizes the text data and prepares it for model input.

Model Training
The BERT-based model is fine-tuned for sentiment analysis. The model architecture and training parameters can be modified in the create_model function.

To train the model, run the following command:


python train_model.py --data_path data/Bully_Dataset_Positive_Negative_Neutral.csv

Inference
You can make predictions on new text data using the trained model. Use the predict_sentiment function in inference.py. Here's how to use it:

python

from inference import predict_sentiment

input_text = "This is a great product!"
predicted_sentiment = predict_sentiment(input_text, model, tokenizer)
print("Predicted Sentiment:", predicted_sentiment)
